          <p class="lead">Each card will feature the HTTP verb or status, the associated status codes, and short colloquial explanation.</p> <p>For example, the two of diamonds features the 202 - Accepted HTTP status code. Technically speaking, "202" is sent when a client, someone like you who, is sending data to a website that needs to processed in some way, like a video. </p><p> Think about when you've uploaded a video to Youtube or Vimeo, it's not immediately available for viewing, because the server needs to process the video. If the "202 - Accepted" wasn't sent, you would have to keep that webpage open until the server finished processing - that could take almost an hour! The "202" let's your browser know that the data is received and you can move on with your life!</p>

            <ul>
            <li>King: GET – The HTTP GET verb is used to retrieve (or read) a representation of a resource</li>
            <li>Queen: OPTIONS - This method allows you to find which verbs you can use to interact with a server - such as GET, POST, PUT,etc.</li>
            <li>Jack: HEAD -  HEAD is a faster way of checking the headers and some server info for a given resource on the server.</li>
            <li>10: 100 Continue - Sometimes we need to check with the server before we send our full request, basically ask "Is it cool to do what I'm trying to do?". The server responds with a 100!</li>
            <li>9: 409 Conflict - Server could carry out request, but it would create a duplicate of something or delete a file that something else depends on!</li>
            <li>8: 401 Unauthorized -  Client doesn't have an authentication token or its now invalid, need to login again!</li>
            <li>7: 304 Not Modified - a conditional GET requests asks the server if anything has changed? Server says 304!</li>
            <li>6: 203 Created - data POST fulfilled and something was created! i.e. Your blog post is created!</li>
            <li>5: 503 Service Unavailable - the server is either overloaded or down for maintenance, it's temporary...hopefully!</li>
            <li>4: 408 Request Timeout - the server got tired of waiting for the client to request something, so it left...go find it again using the domain name!</li>
            <li>3: 301 Moved Permanently - that website is no longer at that domain, but we'll forward your mail...I mean request to the new address.</li>
            <li>2: 202 Accepted - You uploaded a video to Youtube, it was Accepted! But boo, you have to wait for it to be processed to watch it!</li>
            <li>Ace: 200 OK - When server fulfills a GET successfully, i.e. the website loads or the download starts!</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <li>King POST – The POST verb is most-often utilized for creation of new resources </li>
            <li>Queen PUT – PUT is most-often utilized for update capabilities </li>
            <li>Jack DELETE – DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to delete a resource</li>
            <li>10: 101 Switching Protocols - Some web applications like instant messaging or chatting use web sockets, a different protocol from HTTP, the 101 code let's us know the server is ready to switch!</li>
            <li>9: 500 Internal Server Error - Server tried, but failed. If doesn't know what to say, it will at least say 500!</li>
            <li>8: 403 Forbidden - The server understood the request but the client is not allowed to see! Logging in will make no difference</li>
            <li>7: 400 Bad Request - the client request makes no sense, its malformed - server is scurred.</li>
            <li>6: 204 No Content - a DELETE request doesn't require any content returned</li>
            <li>5: 502 Bad Gateway - the server had to talk to another program and something went wrong there...a programmer needs to fix this!</li>
            <li>4: 410 Gone - the resource requested is gone and ain't comin' back. You'll have to think of something else.</li>
            <li>3: 402 Payment Required - this is reserved for future use as part of a digital cash payment system - Apple Pay?</li>
            <li>2: 420 Enhance Your Calm - if you make too many requests of Twitter's servers, they tell you to chillax for a while before talking to them again.</li>
            <li>Ace: 404, Not Found - No clue what you are asking for!</li>
